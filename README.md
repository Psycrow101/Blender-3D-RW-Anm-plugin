# io_scene_rw_anm

This plugin for Blender 3D allows you to import and export RenderWare animations (`.anm`, `.ska`). Based on [Renderware-.anm-IO-Tool](https://github.com/Shadowth117/Renderware-.anm-IO-Tool)

The following ANM formats are supported:
* Common RenderWare `.anm`
* 8ing `.tmo` (import only)
* TM Studios `.xanm` (import only)
* TM Studios `.rotanm`
* Climax Studios `.anm`

## How to import animation

1. Import DFF model into Blender
2. Make armature active
3. Import ANM animation

For a more accurate animation export, it is proposed to snap keyframes in the timeline.
